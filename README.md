Adaptive filter algorithm examples and DSO build helper for ATFA
================================================================

ATFA is the [Ambiente de Testes para Filtros Adaptativos][1] (Testing
environment for adaptive filters).

Quick How-To
------------

The algorithms must be compiled and linked into a `*.so` file. This can
be done manually, or by using the helper script `[build.py][2]`. 
Aditionally, the script `build-all.sh` can also be used to compile all
of the examples at once.

If you just want to compile the examples to use from ATFA, type:

    $ cd atfa-examples
    $ chmod +x build-all.sh build.py
    $ ./build-all.sh

Algorithm examples
------------------

ATFA accepts custom adaptive filtering algorithms in the form of dynamic
shared object (*.so) files. Each adaptive filter DSO must export the
following symbols:

* `adapf_init`
* `adapf_restart`
* `adapf_close`
* `adapf_run`
* `adapf_getw`
* `adapf_title`
* `adapf_listing`

The last two (`adapf_title` and `adapf_listing`) are generated
automatically by the `[build.py][2]` script. Below, each of the
functions to be exported is explained:

* `void *adapf_init()`: The `adapf_init` function initializes (e.g.,
  acquires memory for) the data structures that the algorithm will use.
  This data structure must include the impulse response vector, the
  input vector, and any other information the algorithm wants to keep
  track of. This function must return a pointer to the initialized data.
* `void *adapf_restart(void *data)`: This function resets the
  information contained in `data` (e.g., zeroes out the impulse response
  that has been learned so far), and returns a pointer to the zeroed
  data. This function might free the memory pointed to by the old data,
  and return a pointer newly allocated-and-initialized memory.

How to compile an algorithm
---------------------------

To compile an algorithm into a DSO file to be used with ATFA, use the
`[build.py][3]` helper script.
